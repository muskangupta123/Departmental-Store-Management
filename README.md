# Departmental-Store-Management

Project Description:
I have developed a Departmental Store Management System to streamline the operations
of a small departmental store. The store owner currently manages their inventory and sales
manually, which has become inefficient and error-prone. The new system should automate
various aspects of inventory management and provide an easy-to-use interface for the store
staff.

Requirements:

1. Item Management: Implement functionality to add, edit, delete, and display items in the
store's inventory. Each item should have attributes such as a unique code, name, price, and
quantity in stock.

2. Billing: Design a billing system that allows staff to create bills for customers by selecting
items from the inventory. The system should calculate the total bill, considering the quantity
of each item and applying appropriate discounts if applicable.

3. Search and Reporting: Develop a robust search system that allows users to search for
items by code, name, or price range. Additionally, provide reporting features such as
generating daily sales reports and low-stock alerts.

4. File Handling: Implement file handling to save and load inventory data. Ensure that the
inventory data persists between program runs.

5. User Interface: Create an intuitive menu-driven interface that facilitates easy navigation
and interaction with the system.

6. Error Handling: Implement error-handling mechanisms to prevent crashes due to
incorrect user inputs or file-related issues.
